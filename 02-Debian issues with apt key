Thanks!  This worked.

 

For others that run into this problem:

Use a .zip/.tar/.rar extractor to open the .deb file and find the "postinst" file. 


Open in text editor and copy from "-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----" to "-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----" and save as "dropbox.asc"


into the /usr/share/keyrings/ directory.  


Edit "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/dropbox.list" to read "deb [arch=i386,amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/dropbox.asc] http://linux.dropbox.com/debian sid main" 


or whatever version of Debian you are using.  Run apt update.  It should not give you an error anymore.
