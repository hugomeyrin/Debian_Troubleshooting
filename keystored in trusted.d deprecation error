USE AS EXAMPLE DON'T COPY PASTE BLINDLY

Hello, as install of current GPG usign apt-key that is deprecated in Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22.04, I solved in that way:

wget -O- https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/sublimehq-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/sublimehq-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/dev/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list

Then it working as fine!
