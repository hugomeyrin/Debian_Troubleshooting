I have been having the same issue sporadically with Debian 10 on a Lenovo system too old for any BIOS/UEFI update support. Based on https://wiki.debian.org/Microcode, I did the following for my system:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Add contrib non-free to all deb and deb-src lines. For example: (replace them ) no ADD this is very important!!!! 
deb http://security.debian.org/ stretch/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ stretch/updates main contrib non-free
sudo apt update
sudo apt install intel-microcode Note: Use amd64-microcode instead if appropriate
Reboot to activate the microcode update
The microcode update will be applied only if the kernel or user-space utilities determine the update is required. The microcode package must remain installed for the microcode update to remain active.

hat we can learn so far:

It happens on both X11 and Wayland.
It happens to multiple people. @cpoul and me are confirmed.
It happens on Fedora and openSUSE, so it isn't distro specific.
The audio error I was seeing in my logs is unrelated.
So the error is now confirmed to be the code in this comment (or the function that incorrectly triggers it): #4764 (comment 1305790)

It has existed since GNOME 40 back in April at least. Maybe earlier. I was running GNOME 40 and constantly getting this freeze. Two weeks ago I upgraded to 41 and yesterday to 41.1 without any improvement.

If you can tell me how you made the trace that implicates a window in Android Studio then I will check which application triggers it on my system.
